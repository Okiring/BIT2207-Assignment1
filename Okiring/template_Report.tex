\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Going on a date basically means two people getting together for an activity when the possibility of romance between them has been broached but not ruled out. Since the exploration of romance is the purpose of a date, merely asking some out on a date is sufficient to broach the subject. Dates may or not continue once a couple has entered into a romantic relationship. The word “date” may be used to identify a get together between two people not romantically involved.}

\section{Items you will need.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Flowers, Candy or something a little sweet
	\item A date planned
	\item A car (optional)
	\item Her address
	\item Good clothes
	\item Some money enough for the date
\end{enumerate}
\section{THINGS YOU SHOULD DO}
\subsection{Call. Don’t text. }
\paragraph{That a phone call achieves in one minute what back and forth text messaging will in twenty, is enough reason to give your date a ring. But beyond the practicality, a call is a simple way to humanize your interaction and put both parties at ease. A phone call says, “Hi, I am confident and want to go out with you. So I am going to.” Your date will feed off of your energy—if she feels like you’re comfortable (even if you’re not), chances are higher that she will be too.}

\subsection{Suggest an activity}
\paragraph{You might be nervous about suggesting an activity—does she like ethnic food? (You can ask her with your new phone call skills.) Is bowling too nerdy? Is dinner and a movie too cliche? But it really doesn’t matter. Own what you choose to do with confidence and she will be happy to join you}

\subsection{Pick her up}
\paragraph{If you just met, she might decline the offer, but offering to lend a ride is thoughtful to do. It’s just one more way to show your date that you are considerate and will go out of your way to make the evening as enjoyable as possible for her. }


\subsection{Make eye contact}
\paragraph{Making eye contact with the person you are talking to is not a date-only thing. It is a life thing. Do it. }

\subsection{Control the wandering eye}
\paragraph{If you have the eye contact down, don’t practice your skills with the server or a girl you walk by on the street. Your date will notice and appreciate if your eyes are on her}



\subsection{Tips and warnings}
\paragraph{Be a gentleman and you will impress your date with sweetness
	Ask friends advice on where to take your date if you can’t think of  any places, female friends are extremely helpful with this.
	Plan your date for a fairly early time in case she has to work the next morning or has to get up early.
	Don’t talk to your date about any ex-relationships you may have had.
}
\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{The first impression is the most important one and can make or break a potential new relationship. If you want to impress a girl on the first date, be yourself, and be considerate. Girls love to know that you thought of them enough to do something just a little special for them.}
